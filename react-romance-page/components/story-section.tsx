            Around 2016, a young male pigeon caught sight of a beautiful female pigeon. Those eyes—big and breathtaking—captivated him instantly. He fell hard, completely and utterly.

          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg">
            For 10 years, every single day, he wished and prayed to be with her. He counted mornings, he watched sunsets, he dreamed of a moment when his heart's desire would become reality.

          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg">
            Then came 2021. His prayers were finally answered. Hope bloomed in his chest like spring flowers—a glimmer, a promise that one day, just one day, they would be together forever.

            This countdown is his love language, his way to surrender to time and embrace the beautiful moment that awaits...
